## Doc Unchecked Counts
| Phase | Unchecked Count |
|---|---:|
| Phase 1 | 0 |
| Phase 2 | 0 |
| Phase 3 | 0 |

## Runtime Test Snapshot
| Phase | Status | PASS Lines | FAIL Lines |
|---|---|---:|---:|
| Phase 1 | PASS | 39 | 0 |
| Phase 2 | FAIL | 13 | 1 |
| Phase 3 | PASS | 32 | 0 |

## Missing-Point Hint
- If "Unchecked Count" > 0: sync doc checklist with real evidence after implementation.
- If test status is FAIL: inspect /tmp/phase*_status.log and fix failing stage first.
